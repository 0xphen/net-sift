# net-sift

This library offers an efficient and versatile protocol parser for network packets, featuring an almost dependency-free architecture. It provides support for a range of key network protocols such as IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet frames, UDP, TCP, ARP, and more. The development efforts are primarily concentrated on the most prevalent protocols within the internet and transport layers.

## Supported Protocols:
- :heavy_check_mark: means the protocol is implemented.
- üèóÔ∏è means that the protocol is partially implemented or is under active construction.
- :x: means that the protocol is not currently implemented.

| Protocol  | Supported        |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Ethernet Frame | :heavy_check_mark: |
| IPv4    | :heavy_check_mark:          |
|IPv6 | :heavy_check_mark: |
| TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) |  :heavy_check_mark:         |
| UDP (User Datagram Protocol) |  :heavy_check_mark:        
| ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) |  üèóÔ∏è          |
|ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) | :x:          |
| HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure) | :x:          |
